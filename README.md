# Hospital Management System

The `hospital-management` repository is an application designed to streamline and optimize the management of a hospital's day-to-day operations. This system centralizes tasks such as patient management, doctor scheduling, and staff monitoring all in one place.

## About the Project

This repository includes:
- **Patient Management**: Records and monitors patient information, including admissions, discharges, and medical history.
- **Doctor Scheduling**: Assigns and manages shifts for doctors efficiently.
- **Staff Management**: Tracks staff availability, roles, and schedules.
- Provides a centralized platform for optimizing workflows and reducing manual paperwork.

## Language Composition

This project involves:
- **Backend**: Implemented to handle the server-side functionalities and database operations.
- **Frontend**: A user-friendly interface for real-time access to data and operations.

## Features

- Manage patient records and history easily.
- Schedule, assign, and monitor doctor and staff shifts.
- Simplify hospital workflows to improve operational efficiency.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/utasar/hospital-management.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd hospital-management
   ```
3. Setup and run the system:
   - Make sure the backend is running (if applicable):
     ```bash
     npm start    # Or any backend setup command based on the implementation
     ```
   - Access the frontend:
     Open your browser and go to the local instance of the system (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

## Future Plans

- **Advanced Reporting Dashboards**: Integrate analytics for better decision-making and performance monitoring.
- **AI Integration**: Use AI to schedule staff and allocate resources dynamically based on hospital requirements.
- **Telehealth Features**: Add support for virtual patient-doctor interactions and remote healthcare monitoring.
- **Multi-Hospital Support**: Enable management of multiple branches within one centralized system.

This solution focuses on scalability and improving hospital operational workflows, with room to integrate future advancements as the system evolves.
